Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the total costs and total customers acquired in each year, we need to use the SELECT statement along with the SUM function to calculate the sum of money spent and customers acquired. We also need to use the GROUP BY clause to group the data by year.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's write the first part of the solution. We will use the SELECT statement to select the year, sum of money spent as total_money_spent, and sum of customers acquired as total_customers_acquired from the uber_advertising table. We will also use the AS keyword to give aliases to the calculated columns.

SELECT
  year,
  sum(money_spent) AS total_money_spent,
  sum(customers_acquired) AS total_customers_acquired
FROM
  uber_advertising
