Find employees who started in February and have odd-numbered employee IDs.

Table: worker
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find employees who started in February and have odd-numbered employee IDs, we need to use the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause should include two conditions: one for the joining date in February and another for the odd-numbered employee IDs.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's break down the conditions in the WHERE clause. For the first condition, we can use the MONTH() function to extract the month from the joining_date column and compare it to 2. For the second condition, we can use the modulo operator (%) to check if the worker_id is odd (not divisible by 2).

Here's the corresponding code:

SELECT *
FROM worker
WHERE MONTH(joining_date) = 2
  AND worker_id % 2 <> 0;
Hint #3
Well done! You're making progress! Now you have the complete code to find employees who started in February and have odd-numbered employee IDs. This code will select all columns from the worker table where the joining_date is in February and the worker_id is odd.

Here's the entire code:

SELECT *
FROM worker
WHERE MONTH(joining_date) = 2
  AND worker_id % 2 <> 0;
worker

# SOLTUION:
select * from worker
where month(joining_date)=2 and worker_id%2 <> 0;
