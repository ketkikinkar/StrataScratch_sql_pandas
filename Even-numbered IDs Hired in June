Find employees who started in June and have even-numbered employee IDs.

Table: worker
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To solve this problem, we need to find employees who started in June and have even-numbered employee IDs.

Hint #2
Keep going! To find employees who started in June, we can use the MONTH() function in SQL. Combine this with the condition for even-numbered employee IDs using the modulus operator (%).

Corresponding code blocks:

SELECT *
FROM worker
WHERE MONTH(joining_date) = 6
Hint #3
Well done! Now, to complete the solution, we need to add the condition for even-numbered employee IDs. We can do this by adding another condition using the modulus operator (%).

Entire code:

SELECT *
FROM worker
WHERE worker_id % 2 = 0
  AND MONTH(joining_date) = 6
worker
