Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the number of entries per star, we need to group the records by the "stars" column and count the number of entries in each group. We also need to order the records by stars in ascending order.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's write the first part of the solution. We can use the SELECT statement to select the "stars" column and count the number of entries using the COUNT(*) function. We can also use the AS keyword to rename the count column as "n_entries". Don't forget to include the FROM clause to specify the table "yelp_reviews".

SELECT 
    stars,
    count(*) AS n_entries
FROM yelp_reviews
Hint #3
Well done! Now let's complete the solution. We need to add the GROUP BY clause to group the records by the "stars" column. We also need to add the ORDER BY clause to order the records by stars in ascending order.

SELECT 
    stars,
    count(*) AS n_entries
FROM yelp_reviews
GROUP BY 
    stars
ORDER BY
    stars
yelp_reviews
