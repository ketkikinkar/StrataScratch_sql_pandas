Table: airbnb_reviews
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find whether hosts or guests give higher review scores based on their average review scores, we need to calculate the average review score for each group and compare them.

Hint #2
To calculate the average review score for each group, we can use the SELECT statement with the AVG() function. We also need to group the results by the "from_type" column.

Here is the code snippet for calculating the average review score for each group:

SELECT from_type, ROUND(AVG(review_score), 2) AS avg_score
FROM airbnb_reviews
GROUP BY from_type
Hint #3
To determine which group has the higher average review score, we can use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results in descending order based on the average score. Then, we can use the LIMIT 1 clause to only retrieve the highest average score.

Here is the complete code snippet:

SELECT from_type, ROUND(AVG(review_score), 2) AS winner
FROM airbnb_reviews
GROUP BY from_type
ORDER BY winner DESC
LIMIT 1
