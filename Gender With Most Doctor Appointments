Table: medical_appointments
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the gender that has made the most number of doctor appointments, we need to count the number of appointments for each gender and then determine the gender with the highest count.

Hint #2
To count the number of appointments for each gender, we can use the COUNT() function along with the GROUP BY clause. This will group the appointments by gender and calculate the count for each group. We can then order the results in descending order using the ORDER BY clause and limit the output to only the first row using the LIMIT clause. Keep going!

SELECT gender,
       COUNT(appointmentid) AS n_appointments
FROM medical_appointments
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY n_appointments DESC
Hint #3
Well done! Now, to find the gender with the highest number of appointments, we can add the LIMIT clause at the end of the query to only retrieve the first row, which will be the gender with the highest count.

SELECT gender,
       COUNT(appointmentid) AS n_appointments
FROM medical_appointments
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY n_appointments DESC
LIMIT 1;
Great job! You have successfully written a query to find the gender that has made the most number of doctor appointments. The output will include the gender along with the corresponding number of appointments. Keep up the good work!
