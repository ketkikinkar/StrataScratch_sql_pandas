Find the price of the cheapest property for every city.

Table: airbnb_search_details
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the price of the cheapest property for every city, we need to use the SELECT statement to select the city and the minimum price for each city. We can achieve this by using the MIN function and grouping the results by city.

Hint #2
Great job! Now, let's write the first part of the solution. We will use the SELECT statement to select the city and the minimum price for each city from the airbnb_search_details table. We will also use the AS keyword to rename the minimum price column as min_price. Here's the code snippet:

SELECT 
   city,
   min(price) AS min_price
FROM airbnb_search_details
Hint #3
Well done! We're almost there. Now, we need to group the results by city using the GROUP BY statement. This will ensure that we get the minimum price for each city. Here's the entire code snippet:

SELECT 
   city,
   min(price) AS min_price
FROM airbnb_search_details
GROUP BY 
    city
airbnb_search_details
