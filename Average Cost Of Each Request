Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the average cost of each request status, we need to use the SELECT statement along with the AVG function. We also need to group the results by the request status column.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's write the SQL query to select the request status and average cost from the uber_ride_requests table. Don't forget to include the GROUP BY clause to group the results by request status.

SELECT
  request_status,
  AVG(monetary_cost) AS average_cost
FROM
  uber_ride_requests
GROUP BY
  request_status;
Hint #3
Well done! You're making progress! Here is the entire code snippet that will give you the average cost of each request status:

SELECT
  request_status,
  AVG(monetary_cost) AS average_cost
FROM
  uber_ride_requests
GROUP BY
  request_status;
uber_ride_requests
Preview
