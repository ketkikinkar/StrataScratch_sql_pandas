A wine is considered to be expensive if its price is $200 or more.

Table: winemag_p1
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the number of US-based wineries that have expensive wines, we need to use the SELECT statement with the COUNT and DISTINCT functions.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's add the necessary conditions to the WHERE clause. We want to filter for wines from the country 'US' and with a price greater than or equal to 200.

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT winery) AS n_wineries
FROM
    winemag_p1
WHERE
    country = 'US' AND 
    price >= 200;
Hint #3
Well done! You have completed the query. This will give you the number of US-based wineries that have expensive wines.
