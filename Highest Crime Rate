Find the number of crime occurrences for each day of the week.
Output the day alongside the corresponding crime count.

Table: sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the number of crime occurrences for each day of the week, we need to group the data by the day_of_week column and count the occurrences of each category.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's write the first part of the solution. We can use the SELECT statement to select the day_of_week column and count the occurrences of each category using the count() function.

SELECT
    day_of_week,
    count(category) as n_occurences
Hint #3
Well done! Now let's complete the solution. We need to specify the table we are selecting from (sf_crime_incidents_2014_01), group the data by the day_of_week column using the GROUP BY clause, and order the results by the number of occurrences in descending order using the ORDER BY clause.

SELECT
    day_of_week,
    count(category) as n_occurences
FROM sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
GROUP BY
    day_of_week
ORDER BY
    n_occurences DESC
