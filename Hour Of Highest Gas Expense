Find the hour with the highest gasoline cost. Assume there's only 1 hour with the highest gas cost.

Table: lyft_rides
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the hour with the highest gasoline cost in the "lyft_rides" table, we need to use the SELECT statement to retrieve the "hour" column. We also need to order the results by the "gasoline_cost" column in descending order. Finally, we can use the LIMIT clause to only retrieve the first row, as we assume there is only one hour with the highest gas cost.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's write the SQL query to retrieve the hour with the highest gasoline cost. We can use the following code:

SELECT hour
FROM lyft_rides
ORDER BY gasoline_cost DESC
This query selects the "hour" column from the "lyft_rides" table and orders the results by the "gasoline_cost" column in descending order.

Hint #3
Well done! Now, to limit the results to only the hour with the highest gasoline cost, we can add the LIMIT 1 clause at the end of our query. Here's the complete code:

SELECT hour
FROM lyft_rides
ORDER BY gasoline_cost DESC
LIMIT 1
This query will return the hour with the highest gasoline cost from the "lyft_rides" table.
