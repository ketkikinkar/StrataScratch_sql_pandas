Find doctors with the last name of 'Johnson' in the employee list. The output should contain both their first and last names.

Table: employee_list
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
The goal is to retrieve the first and last names of employees who are doctors with the last name 'Johnson' from a database table named 'employee_list'. This criteria is specified using a WHERE clause to filter the results of the SELECT statement.

Hint #2
Keep pushing forward! You will need to use the correct column names as specified in the database table to select only the desired fields. Start by writing a SELECT statement that specifies the columns 'first_name' and 'last_name', and then, narrow down your search with a WHERE clause that includes the conditions for 'last_name' and 'profession'. The code for this part is as follows:

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee_list
WHERE last_name = 'Johnson' AND profession = 'Doctor';
Hint #3
Great job! You've now specified what to select and the conditions to match. By executing the SQL query you've constructed, you should be able to obtain a list of employees who meet the conditions of having 'Johnson' as a last name and 'Doctor' as a profession. Here is the entire code that will provide you with the desired output:

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee_list
WHERE last_name = 'Johnson' AND profession = 'Doctor';
employee_list
