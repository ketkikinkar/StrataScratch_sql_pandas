Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.

Tables: db_employee, db_dept

Hint #1
To calculate the difference between the highest salaries in the marketing and engineering departments, we can use the ABS function to get the absolute difference. 
We will need to join the employee and department tables and use the MAX function with a CASE statement to filter the salaries based on the department.

Hint #2
Keep going! In the first part of the solution, we need to use the MAX function with a CASE statement to filter the salaries based on the department. 
We can use the emp.salary column and set it to 0 for departments other than marketing and engineering.
MAX(CASE 
     WHEN dept.department = 'marketing' THEN emp.salary 
     ELSE 0 
   END)

Hint #3
Well done! In the remaining part of the solution, we need to subtract the maximum salary in the engineering department from the maximum salary in the marketing department. 
To get the absolute difference, we can use the ABS function.

SELECT ABS(MAX(CASE 
                 WHEN dept.department = 'marketing' THEN emp.salary 
                 ELSE 0 
               END) - 
           MAX(CASE 
                 WHEN dept.department = 'engineering' THEN emp.salary 
                 ELSE 0 
               END)) AS salary_difference 
FROM db_employee emp 
JOIN db_dept dept ON emp.department_id = dept.id

db_employee
id: int
first_name:varchar
last_name:varchar
salary:int
department_id:int

db_dept
id:int
department:varchar
