Table: olympics_athletes_events
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To order all countries by the year they first participated in the Olympics, we need to use the SELECT statement to retrieve the National Olympics Committee (NOC) name and the minimum year for each NOC. We can achieve this by grouping the records by NOC and using the MIN() function to find the earliest year. Finally, we need to sort the records by the first_time_year and the NOC in ascending order.

Hint #2
Keep going! Now let's write the first part of the solution. We will use the SELECT statement to retrieve the NOC and the minimum year for each NOC. To do this, we need to specify the columns we want to select (noc and MIN(year) AS first_time_year) and the table we are selecting from (olympics_athletes_events). Don't forget to use the GROUP BY clause to group the records by NOC.

SELECT
    noc,
    MIN(year) AS first_time_year
FROM olympics_athletes_events
GROUP BY 
    noc
Hint #3
Well done! Now let's complete the solution. We need to order the records by the first_time_year and the NOC in ascending order. To do this, we can use the ORDER BY clause and specify the columns we want to sort by (first_time_year and noc) in ascending order.

SELECT
    noc,
    MIN(year) AS first_time_year
FROM olympics_athletes_events
GROUP BY 
    noc
ORDER BY 
    first_time_year,
    noc
olympics_athletes_events
