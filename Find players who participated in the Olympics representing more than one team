Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To solve this problem, we need to find players who participated in the Olympics representing more than one team. We want to output the player name, team, games, sport, and the medal.

Hint #2
To start, we can use the SELECT statement to specify the columns we want to retrieve: name, team, games, sport, and medal. We can do this by writing "SELECT name, team, games, sport, medal" at the beginning of our query. Keep going!

Hint #3
Next, we need to specify the condition for our WHERE clause. We want to find players who represented more than one team, so we can use the LIKE operator with the '%/%' pattern. This pattern will match any value that contains a forward slash, indicating multiple teams. We can add the condition "team LIKE '%/%'" after the WHERE keyword. Well done!

Entire code:

SELECT name, team, games, sport, medal FROM olympics_athletes_events WHERE team LIKE '%/%';
